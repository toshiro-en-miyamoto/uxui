## UX storyboards

[UX storyboards](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/how-to-create-a-ux-storyboard/) are early sketches of a user’s journey through a specific flow. They show how users navigate your product, what happens when they use it, or both.

For example, a UX storyboard may show how a new user signs up for an account upgrade. It would show each process step—from the homepage to the confirmation page.

UX designers use storyboards in a project’s early stages. It’s one of several brainstorming templates teams use to understand how users interact with different product features.

Similar—but different—visualizations include:

- Wireframes are blueprints that communicate the structure of a page, feature, or component. They mainly focus on layout and design.
- User journey maps are visualizations of each phase a user experiences when interacting with a product. User journey maps focus on the overall journey rather than a specific process.
- Use cases are scenarios that explain user inputs with a system or interaction with a business to reach their goals. Use cases consider multiple flows, unlike storyboards that focus on one.
- Empathy maps are grids that visualize the feelings and behaviors of a single user or multiple users based on qualitative user research. Empathy maps focus on users’ views and emotions rather than how they use your product or app.

A UX designer might use a storyboard for:

- Brainstorming. Storyboards show the user’s process as the user experiences it. This helps identify areas to streamline or features that are missing or confusing. UX storyboards also serve as a single source of truth when sharing ideas with multiple team members.
- User testing. Before investing time to create a wireframe or high-fidelity artifacts, use storyboards to collect user feedback and iterate. Creating multiple storyboards can help users understand how to interact with your product, identify confusing elements, and see what user flows resonate best with customers.
- Visualizing user research. Storyboards are easier to understand than long user research reports. Digital storyboards also give stakeholders a simple format to review and share feedback.
- Handoff. UX storyboards help developers and other team members understand the user’s journey from their perspective. They also add context to wireframes and mockups design choices.
