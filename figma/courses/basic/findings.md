## UX storyboards

[UX storyboards](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/how-to-create-a-ux-storyboard/) are early sketches of a user’s journey through a specific flow. They show how users navigate your product, what happens when they use it, or both.

For example, a UX storyboard may show how a new user signs up for an account upgrade. It would show each process step—from the homepage to the confirmation page.

UX designers use storyboards in a project’s early stages. It’s one of several brainstorming templates teams use to understand how users interact with different product features.

Similar—but different—visualizations include:

- Wireframes are blueprints that communicate the structure of a page, feature, or component. They mainly focus on layout and design.
- User journey maps are visualizations of each phase a user experiences when interacting with a product. User journey maps focus on the overall journey rather than a specific process.
- Use cases are scenarios that explain user inputs with a system or interaction with a business to reach their goals. Use cases consider multiple flows, unlike storyboards that focus on one.
- Empathy maps are grids that visualize the feelings and behaviors of a single user or multiple users based on qualitative user research. Empathy maps focus on users’ views and emotions rather than how they use your product or app.

A UX designer might use a storyboard for:

- Brainstorming. Storyboards show the user’s process as the user experiences it. This helps identify areas to streamline or features that are missing or confusing. UX storyboards also serve as a single source of truth when sharing ideas with multiple team members.
- User testing. Before investing time to create a wireframe or high-fidelity artifacts, use storyboards to collect user feedback and iterate. Creating multiple storyboards can help users understand how to interact with your product, identify confusing elements, and see what user flows resonate best with customers.
- Visualizing user research. Storyboards are easier to understand than long user research reports. Digital storyboards also give stakeholders a simple format to review and share feedback.
- Handoff. UX storyboards help developers and other team members understand the user’s journey from their perspective. They also add context to wireframes and mockups design choices.

## Product design vs. UX design

[Product design](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-product-design/): Focuses on the **strategy** and **direction** of a produce, ensuring vision, goals, and features align with the target audience, including:

- competitive analysis;
- detailed road-mapping;
- feature prioritization;
- market research.

Product design also can be characterized as follows:

- **Broad context**. Product designers work at the intersection of business strategy, project management, and user-centric design, ensuring the product aligns with both user needs and business goals.
- **Greater sway**. Product designers help shape the product roadmap, making decisions that prioritize features and functionality that maximize ROI.
- **Long-term vision**. Product design supports long-term business goals and overall company strategy. Companies like Atlassian and Spotify focus on scalability in their designs, using tools like variables to maintain consistency as they grow.

UX design: Focuses on the **user experience** within a product, creating user-friendly interfaces and pleasant interactions, including:

- comprehensive user research;
- UI organization and labeling;
- useability testing and feedback;
- wireframing and prototyping.

UX design also can be characterized as follows:

- **Short-term focus**. UX designers often zero in on improving specific features or flows within a current sprint, prioritizing immediate improvements to user experience.
- **Narrower scope**. The UX design process is centered on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience with less emphasis on the broader business context.
- **Less influence**. UX designers focus on understanding and representing the needs of the end user, relying heavily on research and testing to inform their designs.

## Five UI design principles

In digital design, [UI design principles](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/ui-design-principles/) are the overarching guidance designers rely on to create designs that serve and delight users.

1. Hierarchy
2. Progressive disclosure
3. Consistency
4. Contrast
5. Proximity
